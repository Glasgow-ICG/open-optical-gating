This codebase is not yet wrapped up as a proper installable library. In order to import it from code that does not live in this folder, use:
	import sys
	sys.path.insert(0, '/Volumes/Development/Spim_GUI/j_postacquisition/')
(or whatever path).

Note also that I really need to package this up into a proper namespace, so I am no longer doing "from x import *"!


A good preamble is:

% matplotlib inline
import sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sys.path.insert(0, '/Development/Spim_GUI/j_postacquisition/')
from analyze_dataset import *
