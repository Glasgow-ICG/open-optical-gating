    # I can see that returning it could be a reminder that it is changed by the function, but equally it implies to me that
    # if the caller saved the return value into a *different* variable, the *original* object would be unmodified (which is not the case).
    # (We can't resolve this by doing a deep copy(), because the object is a large one that contains frame data.
    #  I would be wary of a shallow copy, because that's just storing up confusion for the future).
    # I will have a think and try and come up with a solution I like for this general issue.
    # -> UPDATE: actually, this is bonkers. As far as I can see, all that is updated is the reference period.
    # We should just return that value from this function, and the caller can do something with it.
