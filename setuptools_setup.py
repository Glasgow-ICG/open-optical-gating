    There appears to be a bug in setuptools (Nov 2020) which
    prevents us from using this supposedly more modern approach:
        https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2353
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63683262/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-setuptools-distutils
    Workaround is to delete pyproject.toml (but we need itâ€¦!?),
    or I could just revert to not using setuptools, which is what I have done for now
